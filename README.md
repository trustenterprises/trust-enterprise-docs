# Getting Started

## The introductory video course 🤩

Wanna grab a coffee and want to chill out for 30 minutes with me and step through the entire process of deploying a Trust Enterprises Serverless client and interaction with a fresh Laravel app, [follow this link. ](https://docs.trust.enterprises/intro-video-course/introduction-of-the-trust-enterprises-project)🚀

## The Goal

A REST API to integrate trust into your SaaS product, at the lowest time cost, while owning the deployment, keeping control of the private keys and without any additional microservice overhead. 

{% hint style="info" %}
This serverless client for hedera hashgraph is currently in beta, there are issues and tasks we are currently working on, if you find anything that doesn't seem right [raise an issue.](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/issues)
{% endhint %}

You can find out about the current [beta release](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects/1) and [mainnet progress](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects/2) with the project by in our [Github projects](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-serverless-consensus/projects).

## What to expect

These are the steps you'll need to follow to start using your hedera hashgraph REST API.

* [Register an account on the hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/register) and generate your testnet or previewnet credentials.

* Start sending requests to your own API, upon successful deployment.
